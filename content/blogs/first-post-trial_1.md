When you start working on a thesis at ETH, you receive a document that set up the entire framework of your work. The formal requirement of writing a thesis is defined in the follwing 5 points:

>+ Time and project management
>+ Practice oral and written presentations
>+ Handling of professional literature and engineering reports
>+ Evaluating, reasoning and „selling“ of results
>+ Communication with supervisors, lecturers and engineers
>+ Get to know your own limits (time pressure and uncertainties)

These requirements set a pretty clear goals that I should reach at the end of my thesis. Now that my thesis has ended, I could review it into these points. 

### How did it started
I studied in environmental engineering institutie at environmental engineering departement at ETH (https://ifu.ethz.ch). ETH has a very good quality of teaching and research in environmental engineering. Most of the research in the field of water is done at [EAWAG](https://www.eawag.ch)--a research branch from ETH, similar to Empa and PSI. There were several topics listed on the ifu webpage for master thesis. I picked the one that interested me the most, which led to a 6 months period of learning experience. 

### My topic: Unsupervised model identification for strongly correlated data source
A translated version of this topic is: **Is the measurement error produced by 2 sensors correlated or not**. Before I came into to do this master thesis. My supervisor had already done a study where they try to develop a method to select optimal number of principal component in PCA. The data source they use comes from a UV and UV-Vis sensor, measuring the NO3-N and NO2-N concentration in the water.

They designed a method based on probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA). The method worked perfectly on the training data set. However, it failed on the experimental data set. A critical assumption that makes PPCA works is that
> Measurement nosie shall be spherical 

But how do you guarantee this assumption stands? **Experiments**


### Time management:
![mt_timeplan](/images/mttimeplan.png)
At the beginning of my thesis, I made a time plan like this in excel, indicating the crucial time stamp as well. It's a 28 weeks process. Failure of plan may lead to actual failure of delivery. When I made this plan, I had it in my mind that it would take immense amount of time to write it. So I allocate much time into it. 
### How did I practice my presentation

### Communication framework with my supervisors

### Where did I reach my limit?
