<p>When you start working on a thesis at ETH, you receive a document that set up the entire framework of your work. The formal requirement of writing a thesis is defined in the follwing 5 points:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Time and project management</li>
<li>Practice oral and written presentations</li>
<li>Handling of professional literature and engineering reports</li>
<li>Evaluating, reasoning and „selling“ of results</li>
<li>Communication with supervisors, lecturers and engineers</li>
<li>Get to know your own limits (time pressure and uncertainties)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>These requirements set a pretty clear goals that I should reach at the end of my thesis. Now that my thesis has ended, I could review it into these points.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-it-started">How did it started</h3>

<p>I studied in environmental engineering institutie at environmental engineering departement at ETH (<a href="https://ifu.ethz.ch">https://ifu.ethz.ch</a>). ETH has a very good quality of teaching and research in environmental engineering. Most of the research in the field of water is done at <a href="https://www.eawag.ch">EAWAG</a>&ndash;a research branch from ETH, similar to Empa and PSI. There were several topics listed on the ifu webpage for master thesis. I picked the one that interested me the most, which led to a 6 months period of learning experience.</p>

<h3 id="my-topic-unsupervised-model-identification-for-strongly-correlated-data-source">My topic: Unsupervised model identification for strongly correlated data source</h3>

<p>A translated version of this topic is: <strong>Is the measurement error produced by 2 sensors correlated or not</strong>. Before I came into to do this master thesis. My supervisor had already done a study where they try to develop a method to select optimal number of principal component in PCA. The data source they use comes from a UV and UV-Vis sensor, measuring the NO3-N and NO2-N concentration in the water.</p>

<p>They designed a method based on probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA). The method worked perfectly on the training data set. However, it failed on the experimental data set. A critical assumption that makes PPCA works is that
&gt; Measurement nosie shall be spherical</p>

<p>But how do you guarantee this assumption stands? <strong>Experiments</strong></p>

<h3 id="time-management">Time management:</h3>

<p><img src="/img/mttimeplan.png" alt="mt_timeplan" />
At the beginning of my thesis, I made a time plan like this in excel, indicating the crucial time stamp as well. It&rsquo;s a 28 weeks process. Failure of plan may lead to actual failure of delivery. When I made this plan, I had it in my mind that it would take immense amount of time to write it. So I allocate much time into it.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-i-practice-my-presentation">How did I practice my presentation</h3>

<h3 id="communication-framework-with-my-supervisors">Communication framework with my supervisors</h3>

<h3 id="where-did-i-reach-my-limit">Where did I reach my limit?</h3>
