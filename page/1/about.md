I had this idea of having a website to write down my thoughts a while ago. It took some repetative effort to get the right template from hugo and make it up and running. Finally, I can write some thoughts of mine here and share it with friends. 

Nowadays, as an Uyghur, as an Chinese citizen, as a fresh graduate from university and as a foreigner living in Switzerland and Germany, life has been offering so many changes that's neither easy to digest on the fly nor to completely ignore it and move forward. For some issues happend somewhere, I want to have my voice and share my thoughts with people I care. Discussions on Facebook, WeChat, and Instgrams are too shattered to generate have some meaningful discussion. So, let's gather here and face the time we are living in.
